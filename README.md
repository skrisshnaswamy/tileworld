## Instructions
### Setup
This project is built on Java 8. It uses the [MASON 14 toolkit](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/)
and requires [Java 3D library](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/java-3d.html).
Follow the [instructions](https://download.java.net/media/java3d/builds/release/1.5.1/README-download.html) to setup Java 3D.

Note: Use MASON 14 and not the latest version. A copy of the MASON 14 test bed jar is added to the repo under testbed.

The repo does not use any build tool and hence there are no build script. Use IntelliJ or Eclipse IDE and add the path to the MASON_14.jar onto the project structure and you're good to go!

### Execution
Execute `Tileworld/src/TWGUI.java` directly from the IDE.

### Experiment
If you want to experiment with different environment setup, it can be changed in `Tileworld/src/Parameters.java`.
